Now a days whole world is familiar with the power of programming language. How python is able to make boring stuff so interesting that the person once choose the python then one never move to another language. Although python has a reachability everywhere. Here we are going to discuss python connection with Microsoft word. How it save my life and time and how I could deliver so boring stuff with so much interest. 

Somehow I was trapped in so boring stuff in my current assignment where my work was repetitive. But my biggest challenge was to deliver quality to customer without hampering business and values.

Reading a 100 page document itself a pain and if you have to do this job again and again then it become life taker. I was good in automation but where software was involved. It was the first time I was automating something for documents. 

Python is so wast that you name the software it has connection. In my case Microsoft word was a famous one. 

My job included

Checking already written customer guidelines 
Checking word tables for specific values as they were specific for products
Release number and so on
Collecting comments in shareable file. 
Any many more
Although this stuff looks straight forward which it is. But when it comes in bulk it become nightmare. 

How I solved

Identified the areas which was respectively easy and taking most of time time. Ex Ensuring some fix value in table cell
Writing individual small scripts in python those features
Ensuring results from those script by few more manual iteration
Integrating individual script together to create a rool with decent GUI
Why Python and Why not Vb-script?

Although vb-script can be anyone's first choice to play with MS Word or excel but to use a python has it own advantage.

Python has super GUI capability
Python has many other extra ordinary libraries. I am planning to merge my learning with Machine learning
Complex logic can be easily written in Python
We can prepare more structured code in Python
We can take our automation to next level where it will be able to integrate seamlessly with world.
In our below example we are going to prepare small tool by just writing few lines of good which will find tables with predefined columns.

Installation

No any big installation is required. Just install python. With that win32com library which supports MS word. That's all and we are ready for next steps.

What we are going to do

We are going to develop tool to automate boring stuff. And from the 1st step itself we will be structured. No hoch poch (lol)

MSWordDocumentChecker.py

We will create small GUI with 2 buttons which will start automation for our identified features.# MSWordAutomation


Conclusion

If you have also stuck with any such thing which became boring for you but still important and you haven't take step in this direction. I would strongly suggest to give a try automation with python. It can save your hundreds of hours and increase the productivity.

Now my all the reports are automated. My tool time to time scans predefined folders and once found new file/modified files, take them for checks and completed without even my presence. Life is peaceful.

Have fun with python and if you any interesting idea for automation and to increase the productivity, you can share with me.
